# Ruby on Rails Starter Overview

The Ruby on Rails Starter demonstrates a simple, reusable Ruby web application based on the Rails framework.

## Run the app locally

1. Install Ruby. If you're on OS X I recommend using rbenv and homebrew, otherwise you're on your own. Make sure to also install Ruby version 2.2.3
2. Download and extract the starter code from the Bluemix UI
3. cd into the app directory
4. Run `gem install bundler` to install bundler
5. Run `bundler install` to install app dependencies
6. Run `bin/rails server`
7. Access the running app in a browser at http://localhost:3000
